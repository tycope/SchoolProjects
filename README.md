# SchoolProjects
Several projects that I have uploaded demonstrating my ability to code in Java.


Bowling Game
  Replicates a game where 10 dice are rolled to simulate bowling pins and then the score of the game is determined using bowling rules. Asserts were added after the program was written to make testing easier.
  
Building Searcher
  Hides a person in a building. Searches each floor simulaneously and returns the person's location. 

Hexagon Game
  Replicates a game where hexagons must be placed in a manner that all numbers face each other.
  
Sudoku Checker
  Gives a mostly blank sudoku and then checks whether the puzzle is solved.
